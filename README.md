# Intro
People are lazy. We enjoy making others do the tough or long-winded work for us. That's why we invented robots that do all kinds of stuff for us. But not everyone has implemented these robots yet. What if I told you that there's a way to automate your Discord server? Wouldn't that be amazing?

## Introducing Automater
Well, as it turns out, there is a way! Originally created as a submission for Discord's Hack Week 2019, this bot allows you to automate every aspect of your server.* And that with no prior programming knowledge! No messing around with stupid configs, every server admin can automate their server using a simple web form. No more inviting all sorts of bots to support just that feature that you like most. With automater, _you_ are in control. Create your own unique features from scratch. I'm telling you, it's great. Absolutely a-ma-zing. Let's make Discord great again.

*Not all functions might be implemented, but easy to support using config files.

## The Challenge
Due to a lack of time, I'll have to finish this within 2 days. Well shit. Wish me luck, amigos.
